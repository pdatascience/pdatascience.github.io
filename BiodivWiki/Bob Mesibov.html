"Names don't come out of thin air. They're generated by taxonomists. These are people who study whole organisms, not sequence snippets. They may or may not be primarily interested in evolutionary relationships and gene flow, in which 'computable' data are particularly useful. They may be instead be primarily interested in learning more about the complex ways in which the named entity fits into its world: ecological relationships, which are not inferrable, only discoverable. Or about the complex ways in which populations of the named entity are distributed and fluctuate in abundance: conservation properties, which are not inferrable, only discoverable. The GNA will help these taxonomists do their work, but no amount of computer time can replace the field and lab time which is devoted by taxonomists to discovering new nameable entities and learning about these whole organisms. Your answer to the question 'Do we really need names?' focuses on 'names'. The 'we' is ambiguous. Those involved in bioinformatics might not need names, but taxonomists do. Specimen and species codes are only temporary placeholders, and may not validly identify or distinguish nameable entities. When a taxonomist publishes a name, 'we', the broader scientific community, have some assurance that the entity involved has an existence discrete enough to allow a whole range of investigations, not just computable ones, to be undertaken on it. There is no 'new biology'. There is just biology, in which an unfortunately increasing number of practitioners believe that the only work worth doing can be done sitting at a keyboard."    </body>
